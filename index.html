            <p>You - yourself, not someone else - need to determine where you want to go and what you want to do in your
                life. And once you make that decision, you can begin mapping a plan to get there and focusing on that
                objective every single day.</p>

            <h3>Become a Web Developer</h3>
            <p>All people dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in
                the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on
                their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.</p>
