            <p>You - yourself, not someone else - need to determine where you want to go and what you want to do in your
                life. And once you make that decision, you can begin mapping a plan to get there and focusing on that
                objective every single day.</p>

            <h3>Become a Web Developer</h3>
            <p>All people dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in
                the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on
                their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.</p>

                <p>People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the
                    darkness sets in their true beauty is revealed only if there is light from within.</p>

                <p>I think that the power is the principle. The principle of moving forward, as though you have the
                    confidence to move forward, eventually gives you confidence when you look back and see what you've
                    done.
